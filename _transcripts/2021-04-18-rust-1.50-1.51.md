__Jon Gjengset__: Hello, Ben.

__Ben Striegel__: Hello, Jon. Good to hear you again.

__Jon__: What a surprise to find you here.

__Ben__: Not really a surprise, because the Rust release train is right on
schedule.

__Jon__: And I guess also because we planned it, I suppose.

__Ben__: We did plan it. That is true. Not surprised, because we didn't just
bump into that right here.

__Jon__: Yeah. All right. How do you feel about being halfway to 100 releases?

__Ben__: Wow, it's it's really, uh It's quite a milestone. I personally am
halfway to 100. Excellent.

__Jon__: Mm. The real question, I guess, is what happens when we tick over
to 100. Does that mean that the "1." gets implemented to "2."?

__Ben__: I suppose.

__Jon__: Scary stuff. Scary stuff. The real question is, does Rust 2 come before
Rust 1.100?

__Ben__: I mean, what do you think? What do you— let's make— right now, let's
make a bet and see if history will venerate our decision.

__Jon__: I think there's a really strong desire to never release Rust 2, because
I think it's just going to cause a lot of pain.

__Ben__: In that case, then let's make a bet on at which version Rust will begin
doing the Java thing, and just totally omit the one point before every single
release number.

__Jon__: Oh, yeah, that's a good one. I think that's going to happen with
release 100.

__Ben__: Maybe. It'd be a good milestone for it.

__Jon__: Yeah, I like that.

__Ben__: All right, that's our prediction. What is it, six more years, we'll
find out if it's true.

__Jon__: And this podcast will be around to give you the message.

__Ben__: We'll be here. Write it down.

__Jon__: All right. So today we're doing Rust 1.50 and Rust 1.51. As has become
tradition now. And that that actually works really well, because 1.50 is sort of
the end of the era before const generics. And 1.51 is the start of the era
after, and clearly, this is going to be a land shift moment. Right, Ben?

__Ben__: Well, it's been rolling in for a while. I think we have a few things
from the previous releases that have been showing the harbingers of const
generics.

__Jon__: And that's why I'm pretty happy why we're doing both of these at the
same time. Because I feel like 1.50 is sort of cleaning up all the stuff inside
the— or rather, inside the standard library that makes use of const generics.
And then 1.51 is sort of, now we're ready to let it loose on the world, at least
in some limited fashion.

__Ben__: I wouldn't quite say all this stuff. There are still some things that
aren't quite perfect, as we'll get into today.

__Jon__: That's true. But that's that just gives us the opportunity to make
things even better in the future.

__Ben__: There's no challenges, just opportunities.

__Jon__: Exactly. So the first thing in 1.50 is const generic array indexing. So
this one struck me as a little weird, because I've always been like, can't you
always just index into arrays? Like, wasn't that always a thing? But I think
what's really changed here is now arrays implement the `Index` trait for any
length array.

__Ben__: Like officially, they do. Previously, it was magic, right?

__Jon__: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And I think the magic didn't implement the trait.
Like, you were able to use, like, square brackets to index, But the the `Index`
trait wasn't implemented for arrays of arbitrary lengths.

__Ben__: So we can remove some edge cases from the compiler, where it's like,
yeah, square brackets should defer to `Index`, unless it's an array, in which
case use this magic over here.

__Jon__: Yeah, and I feel like it's also nice for library authors, right? Like
now, if you're generic over `Index`, you can actually take things that are
arrays without having to force the user to make a slice first.

__Ben__: That's pretty cool. I didn't think about that use case. Yeah, that's
nice.

__Jon__: I mean, I don't know how many use cases are generic over `Index`. The
best example I can think of is, imagine that you have a data type that's, like,
generic over its backing storage, and it implements `Index` if its backing
storage implements `Index`, then that will now work with arrays.

__Ben__: Yeah.

__Jon__: The next thing that, in 1.50 I guess, is const value repetition for
arrays.

__Ben__: So this isn't actually— yeah, this is not, in fact, a brand new
stabilization. This is just sort of an "oopsie," as they call it in the compiler
world.

__Jon__: Yeah, which is so funny. Do you want to talk about the oopsie a little?

__Ben__: Yeah, sure. So in the array repetition syntax. Maybe you've seen it
before. It is `[some_expression; some_number]`, like, you know, 5, 10, whatever.
And that gives you an array of that length filled with that value. Previously—
sort of, in this release, it is acknowledged that you are now allowed to use a
const as the value here. Not for the length, which has always been true, but for
the expression itself. And so— but in fact, this has been true for— what is it?
Rust 1.38, this actually became true. It was accidentally kind of released into
the wild. And in this case, it's not like, really a bad thing that it was, but
it wasn't entirely intentional. Just one of those things that kind of like, went
under the radar. And so now this is acknowledged as being stable.

__Jon__: Yeah, like, accidentally worked.

__Ben__: Yes. So it's official. It actually is here, and you can rely on it
without feeling bad now.

__Jon__: I think one thing that that made me really excited for this is that you
might go, like, well, why are constants interesting here? But with all the work
that's been happening on const— like, the `const`ification that we've been
talking about over the past, what, year or so?

__Ben__: Years.

__Jon__: — is really cool, because now you can do things like, you can store—
you can create an array of `Vec::new()`s because `Vec::new` is a const method
now. Or imagine you have some super complex data structure. You can now store a
const `None`, because `None` is a const. Well, I guess maybe `None` you could
always do that with? No, it had to implement `Clone`— or `Copy`, actually, but
now you can have some really complex type that does not implement `Copy`. But if
you have an `Option` of it, you can still create an array of them by setting
them to `None`. Because `None` is a const expression.

__Ben__: Yeah, it's one of the— I think arrays are the big beneficiaries of the
const generic support landing now, where it's kind of like, they're going from
sort of magical language-provided things, to more like library type, almost.
Still a primitive, still fundamental, and privileged, too, with their own
syntax, but way less of their own, like, special little snowflake sort of data
structure.

__Jon__: Yeah, it's really nice.

The next one is kind of interesting because this ties back to I think what we
talked about in 1.49 in the previous episode.

__Ben__: Certainly, yeah.

__Jon__: Which was— in 1.49, just to sort of recap, was, it suddenly enabled you
to implement `Drop` for unions, and it allowed union fields to not just have to
be `Copy`, but they could also be `ManuallyDrop`. And the idea here is that when
you drop a union, you don't know which variant the union is. That's sort of the
point of a union. It might be one of many different things, so you can't
actually drop any of the fields. And any type that implements `Copy` does not
implement `Drop`. So that's why a union could implement `Drop` and contain
`Copy` types. And what changed in 1.49 was that you— it was also allowed to
implement `Drop` if it contained `ManuallyDrop` types, because they don't get
dropped, they're manually dropped. And what was realized in 1.50 was that
because they are `ManuallyDrop`, it should be safe to assign to them as well.
Right? So imagine that you have a union. You don't really know which variant you
have of the union. It's always safe to just assign to a given field of any of
the variants of the union if it's `ManuallyDrop`, because the act of writing to
the union is safe, right? Because reading from a union is unsafe anyway. And the
value you overwrite gets dropped, but it implements `ManuallyDrop` so it doesn't
get dropped. So the change here is that now it is safe to assign to a
`ManuallyDrop` union field, whereas previously it was—

__Ben__: Yeah, this was a surprise.

__Jon__: Yeah, it was only safe to assign to `Copy` fields before.

__Ben__: Because my mental model of unions is like, well, they're the unsafe
version of enums. And so, like, everything is unsafe, in my mind, for a union.
But actually, it makes sense, sort of like how making a raw pointer in Rust
isn't unsafe, although we'll get to that in a sec. But reading it is. In this
way, sort of, writing to a union is totally fine in this case. But reading from
it isn't.

__Jon__: Yeah.

__Ben__: So Rust is pretty precise about this, to not have to have too much
unsafe lying around, where it's not needed.

__Jon__: And I do really like this sort of endeavor to find— let's make all the
things that are safe be safe. Another thing that that I thought was— like, it
seems like a sort of small change. But it gets us a really cool optimization
that I don't think we've talked about on the podcast before. And this is the
idea that on Unix platforms, `File` now has a niche. *nitch*? *neesh*?

__Ben__: I say *neesh*. I'm not sure; I'm not an English (_unintelligible—
9:57_).

__Jon__: I think it's *nitch*, because a *neesh*, if something is *neesh*, it's—
Well, maybe, I don't know.

__Ben__: This is kind of niche.

__Jon__: Yeah, I don't know. Well, I guess a niche is like, something that's
highly specialized and narrow. So maybe that is what it is.

__Ben__: So, yeah, let's talk about that real quick. So a niche for `File` on
Unix platforms. And so we were just talking about unions, and how a union is the
unsafe version of an enum. And they're unsafe because the compiler, or also, the
runtime code itself can't actually check what variants of your quote-unquote
"enum" you are in right now. You've got to keep track of that manually. And
programmers are distracted, sometimes. Sometimes they're tired, haven't had
their coffee, so they can get it wrong. And that's the idea of, enums can do it
safely; unions can do it unsafely. And enums do it safely, very often most of
the time, or, you know, not a naive sense, by not just having, you know, "thing
A" and "thing B" that are in the enum, the data that you actually want to track,
but also having another field, a secret hidden field, that tracks which variant
of the enum is currently active. It just exists in the enum.

But, Rust being a language all about zero cost abstractions, wants to try really
hard to not impose this extra memory cost on users. And so, what if we can kind
of squirrel away the enum variant data, somewhere inside the data that's being
held in the enum already. And so the obvious example of this is imagine a
reference. Your enum contains a reference somewhere. References in Rust can't
ever be null. They can't ever have the value `00000000` there. So let's just say
that, like— but it's not invalid for it to exist like that on, say, the file
system, or in memory. And so if Rust wanted to, it could put some data there.
And in this case—

__Jon__: I guess in this case, like a single bit of data.

__Ben__: All you need is a single— you have a single bit of data, which doesn't
sound like a lot, but actually that's enough to completely eliminate a byte's
worth, or more, of data from an `Option`, an `Option` being the classic enum
where it's either a thing or it's not, because in the not case, it only takes a
single bit of data to describe. So if you have an option with `Some` contains a
reference to anything, that `Option`, the size of it will only be the size of a
single reference, and not the size of two, in fact, because you would actually,
because of alignment and padding, or I guess just padding in this case, you
would need to have double the size, right?

__Jon__: Yeah, and I think it's interesting because it doesn't have to be just
Option. And I think this is something that's been worked on internally, sort of
in `rustc`, which is to find a way to— and this might have landed already on
nightly, that the niche optimization is actually supported for, I think it's any
enum where one variant does not hold data and there are only two variants.

__Ben__: I think it's been it's been stable for a long, long time. It's not just
nightly. I think this has been around for, like, years now that users have been
able to take advantage of this.

__Jon__: Yeah, but I think what's in nightly now is, if the niche is larger, and
there are more variants, and all of them hold no data except for the primary
one, then you can take advantage of that, too.

__Ben__: Okay, yeah, it gets smarter all the time, so it's a pretty involved
thing. I think it's smart enough to even have, like, if you have nested
`Option`s, it might be able to contain the data for both variants inside of the
niches.

__Jon__: Yeah, depending on the size of the niche, right?

__Ben__: Yeah.

__Jon__: And I guess, to bring this back to the changelog, what has changed in
in 1.50 is that a `File` on a Unix platform is represented as what's known as a
file descriptor, which is really just a number. But it is specifically a signed
number. And it's a number that cannot be `-1` because `-1` is used on Unix to
represent that an operation failed and that you need to go check the error
codes. And so `-1` is a niche for `File` on Unix platforms, because it just— a
`File` cannot ever hold that value as its file descriptor. And so it can be used
to represent `None` for an `Option<File>` instead.

__Ben__: Yeah, squeezing out memory savings. That's a great use of Rust's time,
I think.

__Jon__: That's true.

__Ben__: And those are all for the language features. We have some library
stuff, unless you want to talk more about that.

__Jon__: No, no, I think the library changes in 1.50 are are pretty interesting.
The first one is, like, such an innocuous looking method. So this is the `then`
method on `bool`. And the `then` method is pretty straightforward. If you have a
`bool`, there's now a method on `bool` called `then`, that you pass in a
closure, and then it returns an `Option` of the result of the closure. So the
idea is that if the boolean is `false`, then `then` will not call the closure
and return `None`. If the `bool` is `true`, then `then` will return `Some` of
the value of calling the closure. So this is sort of a cheap, hacky way to turn
a boolean into an `Option`. But the amount of work that it has taken to
stabilize this method is just ridiculous. Mara, who's one of the, I think,
standard library maintainers. So Mara commented on Twitter that this took two
years of discussions, more than 10 proposed renames, several hundred GitHub
comments, with over 10,000 words in total, four proposed final commenting
periods, and several video calls for this to actually land in its current
format.

__Ben__: It's bikeshedding of the highest order. It's so small and trivial, that
means that everyone has to get a word in.

__Jon__: Yeah, and it's interesting, right? Because people had a lot of opinions
here. There were everything from, this should never be stabilized because you
can do it so simply already, it's not worth having a special method for. There
was the argument that, maybe we should just implement, like, `Into<Option<()>>`
for `bool`, and then people can just use `into()` combined with `Option::map`.
Maybe it should be called `and_then`, instead of `then`. It's just— there were
so many proposals, so many suggestions. And ultimately, I think you're right
that it's mostly bikeshedding. But I feel like it's nice to have something that
landed. That's just like, short and sweet. And I know for me, like, this will
come in handy in certain one liners that can be tidied up.

The other thing that that landed in 1.50 is the `clamp` method on `Ord`, and on
floating point numbers, and the two are sort of related, like the reason it
could be added to `Ord` was, I think, because it was added to `f32` and `f64`.
Hm, that might not be true. It's a good question.

__Ben__: They don't implement `Ord`, no. Only `PartialOrd`.

__Jon__: Yeah, you're right, you're right. I think the implementation of of
`clamp` for `Ord` is really interesting, though. So `clamp`, for those of you
who don't know, is it's a method that you give it a lower bound and an upper
bound, and it returns the input value, but sort of saturated to those bounds. So
if the input value is lower than the lower bound, it returns the lower bound
instead. If the value is higher than the upper bound, it returns the upper bound
instead. And this is not hard to implement yourself using `min` and `max`, but
it is sort of weird, like you have to pass the lower bound to `max` and the
upper bound to `min` to get the right value.

__Ben__: It's unintuitive, yeah.

__Jon__: And it sort of twists your brain. And so `clamp` is just a much nicer
way to do it. And there's been a `clamp` method on the integer types for a
while. But now that it's on `Ord`, if you have your own types that implement
`Ord`, you can now use `clamp` directly yourself, which is really nice.

__Ben__: Yes, and `clamp` is defined on `Ord`, but the floating point types do
not implement `Ord`, but there are now just inherent versions of these on those
types— you can still use `clamp`.

__Jon__: I wonder what happens if you clamp an `f32` by not-a-number.

__Ben__: Well, it talks about this, so if it's— let's see. This function returns
`NaN` if the initial value was `NaN` as well. I'm not sure what happens if you
give it a `NaN` in the `clamp` value, because you can't obviously check at
compile time.

__Jon__: Yeah.

__Ben__: We could try that out.

__Jon__: Nice.

__Ben__: `clamp` it to a `NaN`. Oof.

__Jon__: What happens if you— if the upper and lower bound are both `NaN`s,
which `NaN` do you get back?

__Ben__: Yeah, what is the sign of the `NaN` that you get back, if they're both
`NaN`s, but they're different signs.

__Jon__: Yeah.

__Ben__: Nightmare of floating point.

__Jon__: The other stabilizations, I think they're not too exciting. There's
`or_insert_with_key` on `BTreeMap` and `HashMap` entries. So if you haven't used
`or_insert_with`, it's a really cool— if you haven't used `entry`, you should
definitely look up the `entry` API. It's fantastic. But if you have used it, you
might have used the `or_insert_with` method, which is, if you have an `Entry`
into a `HashMap` or `BTreeMap`, `or_insert_with` is, if this `Entry` doesn't
hold the value yet, then insert the value you get from calling this closure. And
`or_insert_with_key` makes it so that that closure is supplied with the key for
the entry that's about to be inserted. This is like a nice quality of life
improvement.

__Ben__: I think that's it for the new APIs.

__Jon__: Yeah, and then, of course, there's the traditional set of
`const`ifications. None that struck me as particularly odd this time. Except
maybe `pow`. So this is the exponent function for integer types. So now that can
be computed at compilation time.

I did also take my my usual deep dive into the detailed release notes. I found
two that were pretty interesting. The first is that the `compare_and_swap`
atomic method has now been deprecated. And this is something I think that has
been— it was decided a long time ago, like back in Rust 1.12 or something, that
this is probably something we wanted to do, but it hasn't actually landed now
until 1.50. And the idea behind deprecating `compare_and_swap` is that atomic
operations are already pretty hard to understand and make your way through. And
the standard library already has the `compare_exchange` method, which is
strictly more powerful than `compare_and_swap`, to the point that
`compare_and_swap`— I think the `compare_and_swap` function is implemented by
calling `compare_exchange`. And so the idea was, we should surface as few atomic
operations as we can get away with, and then just document those really well.
And that's what's happened here. That `compare_and_swap` is now deprecated, and
they recommend `compare_exchange` instead. If you're curious about the
difference between these, it really gets into, like, atomic memory orderings,
which are their own kind of special weird sauce. But basically,
`compare_exchange` is the same as `compare_and_swap`, except that you can
specify different memory orderings for if the swap succeeded or failed. And this
is important in certain lock free algorithms, and also just algorithms that end
up calling `compare_exchange` in a particularly hot loop or on a hot path, where
you can do something useful if the exchange fails. In that case, you don't want
the compiler to sort of, or the CPU to sort of stall out because of a forced
memory ordering if the exchange failed. There's a lot more detail there, that I
don't think it's worth getting into here, but basically, `compare_exchange` is a
more powerful version of `compare_and_swap`, so we should just have that be the
one that's in the standard library.

The other thing I found in the detailed release notes is that Cargo now has
reproducible crate builds. And before you get too excited, this does not mean
that Cargo builds are reproducible. That's still something, I think, that's
being investigated. But that's a much, much larger task. Instead, this is if you
run `cargo package`, which is what happens when you run `cargo publish` as well.
`cargo package` will take all of your source files and your `Cargo.toml`
manifest and stuff, and basically create a source tarball for your project. And
that's what ends up getting uploaded to crates.io. So if you run a
`cargo build`, when all your dependencies are downloaded, it's those `.crate`
files, which are really source tarballs that get downloaded from crates.io and
then extracted. And then that's what cargo builds. And now the process of
constructing those tarballs is reproducible. So if Ben and I have checked out
the same commit of the same, sort of, repository, and we both run
`cargo package` or `cargo publish`, for that matter, we end up producing and
potentially uploading the exact same tarball. Like, they would hash to the same
value. This normally doesn't matter too much, but it is really handy when you
have larger build systems and stuff, where you want to make sure that you only
recompile if you know that something has actually changed. Which means that if
something hasn't changed and you run the same procedure, you don't want it to
create, like, a new file that seems like something has changed.

__Ben__: I imagine it could also be useful just for security, to like, know that
you have read the repo for a crate, and then to actually ensure that the repo
contains the code, or the crate contains the code in the repo.

__Jon__: Yeah, that's also true.

__Ben__: Package it yourself and compare the hash.

__Jon__: Yep, yep. Absolutely. And this is something you can imagine, like
doing— you could, like, check out a bunch of just random crates, and then do a
`cargo package`, and then check that the hash matches what's in crates.io, to
see that no funky business has happened.

__Ben__: Yeah.

__Jon__: I think that's all I had for 1.50. I feel like 1.50 was, like, a sort
of small release. Like all of the stuff there is good, but it's fairly small
stuff, and that's okay. Like I feel like all of it is good, sort of, forward
progress.

__Ben__: That's the train model for you. Sometimes, you know, there's not many
passengers on the train. Sometimes there are.

__Jon__: Would you say that there are many passengers on the train for 1.51?

__Ben__: There's at least one really big passenger on this train. Rust 1.51. The
newest release of Rust. The headline feature of this one, we've been kind of
teasing for quite a long time now, is the const generics MVP. And you got to
stress the MVP part; this is not the fully realized, the final form of const
generics as it will exist someday. This is just the, kind of, most minimally
useful subset that kind of works right now and is solid enough to stabilize. So
in this case, all of the goodies we've been talking about for the past few
releases now, where the standard library is now implementing, say, `Index` for
arrays, and doing all kinds of stuff. Now you the user can do that yourself in
your own code. It's all available to you right now. And I've seen plenty of
folks very thrilled to be able to make use of this in their own crates. And so
if, as a Rust library user, I'm sure within the next few months, you will start
seeing your own dependencies update to make use of this in various cases. So do
you want to talk more about the const generics support here, Jon?

__Jon__: Yeah, I think one thing we're going to see is a lot of projects
deleting macros that they've written to implement a trait for arrays of various
lengths. Right? Like, people have a macro.

__Ben__: That feels good.

__Jon__: Yeah. There's so many of those, that just implement the trait for all
different array lengths up to 32, 64, 100 or whatnot, and all those can now go
away. And suddenly arrays of longer lengths will be much more usable in the
language. This also means that arrays are more useful for things like, if you
want to store, say, an image file that has fixed size— like, known resolution
size, you can now actually store that as a contiguous array with a known type,
rather than having it always be dynamically sized. And that's just really nice.
It just feels more proper. It feels like you're encoding more information in the
type system. That said, there are still some libraries I've seen that have not
been able to fully replace their, either macro, or type system shenanigans with
const generics, because there are a few restrictions still.

__Jon__: Yeah, so I mean, the restrictions are— they're a little bit— definitely
for more constrained, or— not constrained, but more involved use cases. So one
is, you currently can only use, I think it's bools, characters and integer
types. You can only be const generic over those kinds of types. And I think,
sort of, in the ultimate version, right, you'll be able to be generic over any
constant value of any type, or of any particular type you give. That's not
currently something you can do. You also currently can't have the constant
generic have a value that depends on other generic parameters. So you can't say
that, like, I'm generic over some `const M`. And this other type is going to be
generic over `M + 1`, for example. Like, you can't put in expressions that are
themselves generic.

__Ben__: And I think expressions in general are kind of limited right now. You
can't have, like a `where` clause for const generics that are like, you know,
`where X = M + N` or anything.

__Jon__: Yeah, exactly. And it also can't depend on like, other generic types.
So if you have some type that's generic over `T`, you can't use const generic
inside of there, and then pass in, like, `mem::size_of::<T>()`. That's also not
supported yet. So there are some limitations, but they're ones that I think are
expected to be lifted over time. And it was more like the current set that we
have enables so many things that weren't possible before. So we should get that
out the door, because it's just super valuable in and of itself. And then over
time we can relax the restrictions that are in place.

__Ben__: Yeah, there's a great blog post on the Rust Insider blog that we can
link to. Well, let's assume that we have [linked to it][episode] and you can
click it below.

__Jon__: That future selves have already have had added links to.

__Ben__: That, one, future yourself is now remembering to link, and that future
listeners are now remembering to actually click on.

__Jon__: Nice. The the other thing that's really cool, I think, and that that's
sort of related to this const-generic-ification, is that now we finally have a
way to take an array and turn it into an owned iterator. With a slight caveat.
But do you want to talk a little bit about this?

__Ben__: Yeah, sure. So, just briefly, `for` loops in Rust: pretty cool. You can
kind of, like, if you have, say, a vector, you can just say
`for thing in vector` and then curly brace and it gives you an array. And that
is a pretty nice little piece of syntax that any user type can opt into, not
just the standard types, by implementing the `IntoIter` trait. Actually, it's
specifically the `iter::IntoIter` trait. *(editor's note: the trait is called
`IntoIterator`, which contains a method called `into_iter`)* And so if you do
this, then whenever you use this type in a `for` loop, it will implicitly,
behind the scenes, call `into_iter` on that type, and then iterate over that
value that it gives you.

So there's— now that we can possibly implement `into_iter` for arrays. Like,
remember how we just talked about implementing `Index` for arrays. It should be
possible to do it, and it is possible to do it. But there is a bit of a problem.
So in Rust, there is a thing called "autoref." So if you have a method, for
example, let's say you have a method and it takes— there are receiver types.
There's `self` and `&self` and `&mut self` in these methods. How do you call
these? And so if you have an `&self` method and you have a value `foo`, you
don't need to say, you know `(&foo).whatever()`. You can just say
`foo.whatever()` and then Rust will, behind the scenes, generate a reference for
you, to that type. This has some complications with the resolution, though, with
how arrays and slices interact. So slices have always been usable in iterators.
You're always able to say `for x in some_slice {`, and that operates via the
`into_iter` transformation. But the thing is, slices are always reference types,
and so even if you take a slice by value, the elements inside are going to be
by-reference. And so in this case, if you had an array and you tried to call
`.into_iter()` on it, what it's going to do is, it's going to say, hey, I don't
see `into_iter` on this, but I do see that if I reference this, I will get the
`into_iter` implementation on slices. And so that is, today, what happens if you
have an array and you call `.into_iter()` on it. Now it's not—

__Jon__: Or just pass it to a `for` loop, right?

__Ben__: Yeah. Any of this. Well, so today if you pass it to a `for` loop, it
will— if you have a `for item in some_array`, nothing happens. It doesn't work,
and— does it? I don't think it does.

__Jon__: I thought that worked. But let me—

__Ben__: I think it's specifically, the problem is about calling `.into_iter` on
an array, an actual array. And the thing is, because it's going to reference
your array and then turn it into an iterator, you're only going to be able to
get the elements by reference. And so it's actually no better than if you had
called `array.iter()`, because `iter` is the trait— or, it is the method that
gives you a by-reference iterator, naturally. Where `into_iter` is by value,
`iter` is by reference.

__Jon__: You are completely right that it doesn't work. If you do like
`for item in`, and then you give it an array—

__Ben__: Yeah, it wants you to add on the ampersand there, to turn it into a
slice first. So the idea is we could add the implementation of `into_iter` for
arrays. But now suddenly that would break code that— because it changes the
actual value internally of what you get back from the iterator. So that's going
to be— previously it's going to be a reference, now it's just the raw value, the
owned value. So for at least over, maybe a year and a half now, this problem has
been foreseen, even though const generics hasn't been stable for, or even usable
for that long. And so the idea is Rust has been warning for quite a while now
that if you have an array, and you called `into_iter`, you get this warning that
says, hey, in the future, this might change. Just so you know. This is an
example of a future compatibility warning that could change at some point. And
Rust uses these occasionally, often at edition boundaries, to change behavior in
ways that otherwise might break some code. And so there have been various Crater
runs, and Crater is the tool that gets used to check to see if any of the code
on crates.io would actually break from doing this. And there have been some
regressions, from the theoretical doing this. And so patches have been sent, but
many of these projects are older and obviously aren't being maintained anymore.
Kind of just languishing out there. And so the idea is, Well, is there a way of
doing this over the edition, for implementing `into_iter` for arrays? Is there a
way of maybe just breaking it, or way of mitigating it somehow? And so the
compromise that exists right now is to say, hey, let's not worry about
implementing this trait, but let's still provide a way to get an array by value
and not have to make it into a slice first, and only get the elements by
reference. And you could do it via the `cloned` method on iterators, to get a
cloned copy of the values inside the iterator. But we don't want to have to, you
know, introduce unnecessary copies. This is Rust. So there is now a new struct
in the `array` module. It's called `IntoIter`, kind of confusingly. But the idea
being, this is hopefully a temporary, transitive sort of thing. And so the idea
is, if you import `array::IntoIter`, and then you can call `IntoIter::new` with
an array, that gives you an array by value with no extra copies, no fuss. And
so, in the future, this might become redundant. Or, you know, maybe someday even
deprecated in favor, hopefully of having an actual `into_iter` implementation on
arrays. But in the meantime, there's no reason that arrays can't take part in
the fun of being turned into by-value iterators.

__Jon__: I was really hoping that maybe it would be possible to have `IntoIter`
implement `From<[T; N]>`, and they can just do `for item in array.into()`. But
unfortunately, the type inference is too complicated. But I wonder— it sounds
like maybe this will happen on an edition boundary?

__Ben__: Yeah, there are some complications, to be determined. I think right now
there's been another Crater run queued up, to see if the— so one of the things,
the problems, kind of getting into the behind the scenes here, is that a lot of
people wouldn't have noticed the warning because it might have been happening
inside of their dependencies. And with Cargo, when you compile, a warning in a
dependency isn't necessarily shown. And so the idea here is that with these
future compatibility warnings, they will bypass Cargo's hiding automatically, of
any sort of warning, and it will actually show it to the user. And I believe
that recently landed in Cargo. So it's not stable yet, as far as I know. And so
once that does land, then we definitely should be more, confident that people
will have seen this in their dependencies, will have either fixed it, forked the
dependencies, transitioned to new ones somehow. But that might not happen in
time for the edition. And it's unclear if an edition could have, like two
different `IntoIter` traits to control whether or not you're doing this or that.
So there's— it's up in the air still, we'll see what happens.

__Jon__: It's an exciting future prospect.

__Ben__: It's always exciting with Rust.

__Jon__: Speaking of Cargo, actually, Cargo got a pretty major new feature, in
this 1.51 release, too. And that is Cargo got an entirely new feature resolver,
and that might not mean much to you if you haven't been digging around in
Cargo's internals, but basically Cargo's— one of Cargo's primary jobs is to
resolve all your dependencies. So that is, given the dependencies that you
specify in your `Cargo.toml`, and all of the versions that are available on
crates.io, which versions of which crates do I have to compile, in which order,
with which features? It's like, solving that problem turns out to be very, very,
very hard. But Cargo does a pretty good job at it. And one of the, sort of,
let's say, let's call it simplifying assumptions that Cargo made in the past,
and arguably for good reason, was that if you have two paths to one dependency,
so imagine that you depend on `bar` and you depend on `baz`, and both `bar` and
`baz` depend on `foo`, so you have, sort of, think of it as a diamond shape. And
then imagine that `foo` has two different features, feature `a` and feature `b`.
And `bar` enables `a` and `baz` enables `b`. Then Cargo will sort of unify these
features, so Cargo tries pretty hard to avoid compiling anything twice if it can
avoid it. So rather than compiling `foo` once with `a` and once with `b`, Cargo
will just compile `foo` with `a` and `b` both enabled.

And in general that is the behavior you want, because you don't want to, sort
of, compile things lots of extra times, and then have lots of sort of duplicated
but not quite duplicated artifacts sitting around. But the downside of this
unification is that Cargo sometimes goes a little too far. So one example of
this would be, imagine that `bar` is a `dev` dependency and `baz` is a non-`dev`
dependency. Then you don't really want to merge the features across them because
if you're doing a release build, and you're not planning to do a debug build or
you're not planning to do a test build, you just want to build the release. You
don't really then want to compile `foo` with the features that are only used on
testing. The best example of this might be, imagine you pull in something like
`tokio`, right? So `tokio` has a lot of different features. Some of them are
very small, like if you have `tokio` with no features, it compiles basically
nothing. It's just like, a bunch of traits and maybe a couple of types. But
there are some features that bring in a lot of stuff, like if you enable the
multi-threaded executor feature, that's a lot of code that has to be compiled.
Most projects will only include the sort of multi-threaded runtime feature in
their tests, in their `dev` dependencies, because they need them for tests, but
not in their normal dependencies. But the way that Cargo used to work, it would
always compile `tokio` with all of those features, even if they were only used
for testing, and you were doing a release build. And that is, of course,
unfortunate. It means that you spend a lot more time compiling than you
otherwise would. And there are cases where this even breaks builds, and this is
part of the reason why it was decided that a change had to be made. And that
was, imagine that you're doing cross-compilation. So let's say that I'm on Linux
and I want to compile for Windows. Then now imagine that in my build
dependencies, which are run on Linux, I enable the Linux feature of `foo`, and
in my dependencies, so what gets built for Windows when I do a cross-
compilation, I enable the Windows feature. In the old resolver, Cargo would then
go, oh, so I'm going to unify and help you out and compile `foo` with both the
Linux and Windows features. But the Windows features don't compile on Linux, and
the Linux features don't compile on Windows. So I end up just being unable to
compile `foo` when doing this kind of cross-compilation. And so this is a
problem. There are some other examples around hosts and `proc_macro`s and stuff
that we don't need to get into. But basically you can see how this becomes a
problem if you end up over-unifying in a sense.

So what happened was that the fantastic Cargo maintainers decided to implement a
new version of the resolver, that had this behavior that it understands when it
needs to keep features separate, and when it can't unify them. So for example,
you can't unify across targets, across host types, and you probably shouldn't
unify across `dev` dependencies unless you are doing a test build. And that
landed with this additional field you can set in `Cargo.toml` that says
`resolver = "2"`. When you set that, you're telling Cargo to use this new
updated smarter resolver. Unfortunately, the sort of second generation resolver
can't be the default, because it's not backwards compatible. There might be some
crates out there that have a feature enabled in their dev dependencies that are
actually needed to build the crate even if you're not building the tests. But
that wouldn't be visible with the original resolver, because it just unifies
them for you. So it might be that if we landed `resolver = "2"`, as the default,
crates wouldn't build because they would end up with too few features enabled,
when doing a normal build. So for now, it's a specific thing you have to opt
into when you create a new package. But I think the plan is, based on the RFC,
that this new resolver is going to be the default in the next edition. It's a
pretty cool change, like I'm very glad this lands, I think it's going to make a
lot of compilations be faster because you end up not compiling more than you
need unless you need it. It also has some implications, I think, for things like
`no_std` crates where you might want to, like, compile it with `std` support
when it's a build dependency, but without `std` support when it's a real
dependency. Really, this like, second generation resolver's doing things the
right way. Of course, the downside is that now you might end up compiling some
dependencies more than once. But that's sort of, it has to do that for
correctness. But it is a cost that you should be aware of, that this might be
coming down the pike.

__Ben__: Yeah, I think it's a bit too early to say whether or not it will
actually improve compile times, because it might also make them worse. But the
idea being that, hopefully you aren't building your dependencies from scratch
very often, so it shouldn't be a recurring cost.

__Jon__: Yeah, I think the idea is that it's going to improve the time for
release builds. It's going to fix some of these problems that are just like
inherent, right? Like, if you're doing a cross-compilation that are `no_std`, it
might be that you just currently cannot build. And it will fix those.

__Ben__: Yeah. I agree that it's necessary for correctness.

__Jon__: Yeah. There's another feature that landed in, I guess Cargo and
`rustc`. That's sort of an overlapping feature. And this is this notion of
splitting debug information on macOS. This is a little bit, like, hairy and
weird, but basically, when you do a debug build, or any build that has debug
symbols enabled, this is the kind of stuff where, like you run your program, you
get a backtrace, or your program crashes or you try to debug it in GDB. And
rather than just getting like pointer addresses for everything, you actually get
the names. That's pulled out of the debug information. And how that debug
information is stored and compiled varies from platform to platform. And on
macOS, it used to be that all of the debug information was put into— like, it
was passed into this tool called `dsymutil`, which constructed this big folder
that contained all of the debug information. And that that process was fairly
slow, especially if you had, like, a large binary with lots of debug information
and lots of, sort of, instructions, that just meant there was a lot of debug
information. And in particular, it was slow because `dsymutil` had to be run
after linking. So you sort of had to produce your full program binary and then
run it and then end up with all this debug information. And that means that even
if you make a small change to your program, you might need to, like, spend a lot
of time regenerating all of the debug information. And that's really
unfortunate. It means that your bills are slower than they need to be.

So what's cool is that in 1.51, macOS will now take advantage of this sort of
different way of storing debug symbols, where rather than extracting them and
storing them separately, the debug tool that you use, this might be GDB, for
example, or LLDB, I guess, is another example. It understands how to find the
`.o` files, the like, binary intermediate artifacts that get produced during
compilation, and so you can just leave the debug information in there. And then
there are pointers in the final binary that point back to those files. So if you
try to debug your final binary, it will just sort of go to those files to find
the debug information. Which means that if you make a small change to your
program, only the files that needed to be recompiled, like the `.o` files that
need to be regenerated, only those have to be regenerated. And there's no longer
a need to run this, like `dsymutil` at the end. And this really just should
speed up a bunch of compilation cycles on macOS. It is also something I think
that is technically possible on other platforms, but just isn't supported yet.

__Ben__: It's on the way, I believe. Yeah, so for— I think for Windows this has
always been the default. I believe— I'm not a Windows developer, but I believe
that this is just how debug info has always worked on Windows for all time. And
I think that on Unix recently, DWARF v5 came out, and then, like standardized
how this should be done for DWARF, the file format. And I think that is being
worked on right now. I think LLVM understands it and can do it. I think it just
requires Rust to do some more legwork and make sure that it all works.

__Jon__: Yeah, I think you're right. Although I'm not sure about Windows,
actually. I think Windows uses the same kind of structure—

__Ben__: I could be wrong.

__Jon__: I think Windows uses the same kind of structure as macOS, in that it
like, puts the debug information in its own separate file. But I think it's like
a file and not a folder, and you don't have to run this tool, so it just ends up
being a lot more efficient, like it's really just the whole debug section of the
final program binary gets dumped into a separate file.

__Ben__: Yeah. That's what I expect.

__Jon__: As opposed to on macOS, where you have to, like, extract everything
into this folder. So this is like a neat, just, quality of life improvement for
macOS development, I think, which has traditionally been a little bit of a pain
with macOS. Because like, it's not— it's worked fine, but there's been some of
this like, we have to call this extra tool, and that makes compilation slower
and stuff, where this should be— this should definitely, like, improve the
experience.

I think we can also speak like, very briefly to why it took this long to land
this on macOS. Because it's kind of interesting. So under the hood, Rust needs
to be able to produce things like backtraces, right? So if your program crashes,
if there's a panic, for example, it needs to be able to print where the panic
happened. And that happens by unwinding the stack. It sort of walks the— it
walks the callers backwards to where the panic happened and sort of prints the
name of each one. And traditionally it used to unwind using a particular library
or implementation that didn't support these kinds of new— this new debug format
on macOS. It only supported the `dsymutil` one. But then somewhat recently,
there was a re-implementation of this unwinding component in native Rust, and
that native one does support the new format. And so once that landed, we were
now able to move the macOS default to be using this new format and still have
things like unwinding backtraces work. I think it was a really cool example of
sort of this snowball effect, of once this lands, then this can land, and this
can land. Which is similar to what we saw with const generics.

__Ben__: That's it for all the toolchain and language changes, in the blog post
anyway, and then we have new stabilized APIs.

__Jon__: Yeah, so here there's some funny ones, too. One is called out in the
sort of, release announcement itself, which is `ptr::addr_of!` and
`ptr::addr_of_mut!`. So I think we've touched on this briefly, but to recap, in
Rust, you're not allowed to create references that are unaligned. Every Rust
reference must be aligned. Which— what exactly alignment means is sort of too
technical to get into here, but roughly there are rules for what a reference can
and cannot point to. But the same rules don't apply to raw pointers like a
`*mut`, for example, is allowed to be unaligned. And this comes up in things
like, if you have a packed struct, so one where there's no padding in the fields
to sort of come in the order that you list them exactly as you list them. It
might be impossible to generate a reference to any of the fields. And this is a
problem because that means it's also impossible to generate a raw pointer to
those same fields, because generally how you create a raw pointer is, you take a
reference to the field and then you turn it into a raw pointer. But it's
illegal, or it's undefined behavior to create an unaligned reference. So you had
no way to do it. At least if the struct didn't have `repr(C)`, so is using the
Rust representation. And so there's been a lot of discussion of like, how do we
fix this on soundness? Because it's necessary for things like the `offset_of`
macro, which tells you how far into a struct is a given field. Because it
fundamentally needs to do this operation, but there was no safe way to do it.
And what's happened here is that the sort of standard library team aren't
willing to commit to any particular mechanism yet. They have some in mind, like
I think there's an RFC for this idea of raw references that would solve this
problem, but that's still like some way off before it stabilizes. But the need
for this particular feature of getting a raw pointer directly from a field is so
great that they've landed these two macros, which, behind the scenes, use this
sort of yet to be stabilized feature. But the— so they've stabilized the macro
themselves, but not the implementation. Which I thought this is like a really
neat example of being able to do this compartmentalization of what you
stabilize.

__Ben__: Yeah, so as we've mentioned before, maybe you've inferred the standard
library itself is allowed to use unstable features, and that's because the
language and library are pretty closely knit. And so the people behind the
language are also behind the library, and so they can guarantee that they won't
make any language changes that will break anything in the library, and vice
versa, that the library won't use or expose any stable APIs that are using
nightly features, unless those features are like, vaguely stable-ish. Or at
least you can tell that they're unstable in some way. But it's funny because in
this case, the reason that these are macros is because they literally expand to
nightly-only features. And because it's a macro, you can think of it as just
kind of copying and pasting some code out of the macro into your own code. And
then you think to yourself, okay, so how does this work, if I'm making my own
code? And suddenly it just happens to contain some totally unstable code? And
I'm not on nightly. I'm not using any feature flags. And there's just compiler
magic, it turns out, that allows certain macros in the standard library to
expand to unstable features, and doesn't cause any problems for downstream
users. And so if you are using this macro, it doesn't mean that you can suddenly
use this unstable, raw reference feature that's being prototyped. It does mean
that the interface will remain stable forever, but it just means that whatever
it expands to will compile on your code, even though it's kind of a cheat.

__Jon__: Yeah, it's a really neat cheat. I didn't know this even existed, but it
makes a lot of sense.

__Ben__: It's also a little bit thing for me. And it's for a tiny reason, which
is because I believe this is the— well, if you're used to Rust, you'll kind of,
like, maybe understand, without really understanding why, all of the macros that
you see in Rust, it seems like they're all in the prelude: `panic!`, `println!`,
`format!`. All these things, you don't need to ever import them. And this is a
relic of the time when in Rust 1.0, it was impossible to namespace macros. They
just had to always live in the root namespace. And so if you put them inside the
standard library, they're just in everyone's code by default. I believe this is
the first macro to be stabilized that is not in the root namespace. It is
actually namespaced under the `ptr` module. And so it does this, using some
itself kind of unstable support for quote-unquote macros 2.0, which has been in
the works for quite a while now. And it is stable enough to expose here and used
to implement the `addr_of` macros. So I think that's for me, exciting, because I
like to have nice looking documentation, and for me, it's kind of gross to have,
like, you know, here's the front page of the standard library API docs. But also
here's a bunch of— here's a nice list of, like, all useful modules and then,
like a list of totally random, un-namespaced macros that could live somewhere
else, but don't.

__Jon__: Yeah, I wonder, do you think we're going to see sort of modularization
or namespacing of existing macros?

__Ben__: I've honestly thought about writing the RFC for this. Where, just kind
of like, hey, like, find places to live for all these macros, because, I mean,
it's kind of— it's weird in a way, where like, you would think that you would
expect, say, like the `vec!` macro to live in the `vec` module. But it doesn't.
And so it's kind of unintuitive in that way, and obviously you can't ever, you
know, you can't quote-unquote remove them from the prelude, you would need to,
if you did this, you would need to implement the macro in a module, and then
expose it in the prelude, so that no one's code would break.

__Jon__: Well, so there's also the difference here between the prelude and just
the source of the standard library, right? So there are macros that are in,
like, `std::vec`. That's where `vec!` currently lives, I think, the `vec!`
macro. But it would be a matter of like, moving it into the `vec` module. And
then still probably, you would still have to expose it under `std`, because
backwards compatibility and whatnot.

__Ben__: Yeah.

__Jon__: Speaking of macros, there's another, like, macro-related change here,
which is `panic!`. In particular there's a new `panic_any` function which might
strike some people as weird. Like, why do we need a panic function when we
already have the `panic!` macro? Do you want to talk a little bit about the
difference here? I was really surprised to even learn that there was a
difference between `std::panic` and `core::panic` and why this was needed.

__Ben__: Well, that's kind of being ahead of yourself, but actually, so the idea
is that nowadays, at least— I'm not sure if it's stabilized yet, but
forthcoming, there won't be a difference between `core::panic` and `std::panic`.
But in the meantime, there is a feature that is in the pipe right now, that I'm
kind of excited for, and it is implicit formatting arguments for all the
formatting macros. And so, if you've used, for example, many other— pretty much
any other language that has, what do you call it? It's— my mind is—

__Jon__: Exceptions?

__Ben__: No, no, no, no. Not exceptions. In Python the "F-strings". What's like,
the general term for that?

__Jon__: Like formatting strings?

__Ben__: Sure, we'll just call it formatting strings. There's a better— there's
a more general term for it, but like strings—

__Jon__: Interpolated strings?

__Ben__: That's it. String interpolation. Yeah. And so, like any kind of like,
you know, JavaScript has this, and like, the idea is you can just give, have a
string literal, and then just refer to variables in the surrounding scope, and
it will pull those into the literal for you, and kind of format it nicely. So in
Rust, the way you do it instead is, right now you have, like, say, the `format!`
macro, which makes a string, `format!(` and then your template, kind of like the
string literal with all the curlicues inside. And then after that, you have a
list of various identifiers that the macro itself will capture, and then the
macro will expand to something that can use these things. And so the idea being
that there's nothing actually stopping Rust from referring to, or you know, any
kind of, like, string literal used in this way, for a formatting macro, from
referring to identifiers in the surrounding scope. And so there was an RFC that
was accepted and implemented, and it is now on its way. It's maybe being
stabilized, probably this year, I would hope? Not going to give any promises,
I'm not involved. But, the idea being it should kind of bring Rust closer to
other languages that you are familiar with, with string interpolation, where you
don't need to list out the name of an identifier, both inside the string and
also outside of it.

__Jon__: That is really exciting.

__Ben__: So that's cool. And that's forthcoming. But there's a problem. And that
problem is that, so this machinery is going to apply to any macro that
internally calls the `format_args!` macro. And `format_args!` is the secret
sauce behind all of Rust's formatting stuff that, like, checks your types are
all correct, and all this. But there is one exception. Just one exception. And
that is, if the `panic!` macro, if it is called with an argument that is just a
string literal, it does not call `format_args!`. Every other macro, even if
they're just called with a single argument string literal, still calls
`format_args!`. But because `panic!` doesn't, it means that right now it is
legal to invoke the `panic!` macro with just— like, imagine, `"{foo}"`. And so
any other macro, that would give you an error because `format_args!` is like,
hey, you haven't passed in a `foo`, I have no idea what `foo` is. `panic!` just
panics with the string `{foo}`. And that's the only thing that is different
between panic and like, every other macro at this point. So the idea being,
well, like, what do we do about this? There was one weird kind of historical
exception. How do we fix this? And so the idea— this is kind of the first stage,
which is you provide an alternative, where it's, if you are doing this, say, and
you like, for whatever reason, need this to work, you don't want to make any
changes in your own end, this `panic_any` function will do the behavior that you
expect.

__Jon__: Maybe it's worth talking about, too, like, why is it useful to panic
with a type that's not a string?

__Ben__: Just for, like, messages. This isn't like, you know. This is not like,
you know, error handling or exceptions. It's just the idea being that— well, I
guess what you're saying here too is, so like, it'll turn it into a string. So
it'll like, say, you know, you can— It's kind of like, if you want to panic
with, like— it's for `println` debugging, I guess, is the idea. But nowadays, a
thing that exists, that did not exist at 1.0 when this was implemented, is the
debug macro, the `dbg!` macro, which is way better for `println!` debugging than
`panic` is.

__Jon__: So what I was thinking of was actually something slightly different,
which is, if you panic, you can actually supply a value to the panic, and that
value gets returned by whoever catches the panic. So if you call `panic!` with a
value that's not a string, and then let's say that— so that causes the current
thread to start unwinding, right? Imagine some other thread joins with the
thread that panicked. The value that was supplied to `panic` is available to the
thread that joins with that panicking thread. So this is, when you do `join` on
a thread handle, what you get back is, like, the error type of that is something
that you can downcast into the value that was passed into panic. And so this is
one way to communicate, like, why did I panic? And it doesn't have to be a
string. And that's sort of on purpose, because maybe you want to provide some
richer information about why you panicked, and that's available through this
mechanism.

__Ben__: I've heard that one before.

__Jon__: Yeah, so this is why `panic_any` doesn't take a string. It takes any
type that implements `Any + Send + 'static` so that you can downcast into it if
you catch the panic. So it's going to either either be through the
`catch_unwind` function in the `panic` module, or it could be because you're
joining with a thread that panicked.

__Ben__: Anyway, the idea is that— go on, if you want to continue, I was going
to continue, but—

__Jon__: Yeah, so I was just going to say, like, this is the reason why some
people might want to call the `panic!` macro in the past, with just a single
argument that is a string that they don't want interpolated, or something that
isn't a string at all. Like, it's just some other value. And this `panic_any`
function is now the way to do that, rather than using the `panic!` macro, which
is going to start formatting.

__Ben__: Yeah, I'd say it's still pretty rare. And not a thing you really want
to do very often.

__Jon__: Oh, yeah, no, not at all.

__Ben__: Anyway, so the idea being that with the edition, this discrepancy will
be papered over and, like, fixed quote-unquote. So `panic!` will begin to
participate in the machinery of getting the implicit arguments. But this is just
kind of like adding in the ability for people to migrate as well. And just what
you said.

__Jon__: Yeah, I think this is really nice, and sort of separating out that the
`panic!` macro will be for the same things like the `print!` macro are for
except you're also panicking. And then if you specifically want the feature
where you're able to propagate a panic value, that you use the `panic_any`
function, rather than go through the macro. I think that it's like correct
cleanup. It's great.

I think there are two other things I wanted to talk about from the stabilized
APIs. The first of them is pretty straightforward, so it's a bunch of methods
that have been added to slice. This is stuff like `split_inclusive`,
`strip_prefix`, and `strip_suffix`. And these are, at least in my mind, ways of
making slices feel more like strings, or rather, give more of the conveniences
that you currently have with strings. So to take `strip_prefix` as an example,
what `strip_prefix` does is, on a string that is, you can if you have a string
that says `"foobar"`, and you call `.strip_prefix` and you pass in the prefix
`"foo"` the string prefix "foo", it will return `Some("bar")`, so it will slice
the string for you, to not include the prefix you gave. And if the prefix isn't
there, It returns `None`. So this is a really handy way to, well, strip a prefix
from a string, if it's there, and to learn whether or not it's there in the
process. And previously, if you had something like a byte array or something,
and you wanted to strip if it started with a given byte sequence, like for
example, if you're dealing with ASCII text and you have, like, a `u8` slice, and
you want to see whether it starts with this `u8` slice, previously that was
actually really annoying to do. And it's nice to see slices get some of these,
like, just quality of life improvements that we've had for strings for a long
time and really could just have for slices too. I think we're going to see more
of these land in the coming releases, and I'm pretty excited about it.

The other one is `task::Wake`, so we're not going to get into all the details
of, like, how async/await works and stuff. But a `Waker` in async/await is a way
for a `Future` to say that, or for something to say, this `Future` is now ready
to make progress. Like, it returned `Pending` in the past, it was waiting. And
now wake it up, try to poll it again, try to make progress. And previously, if
you wanted to, like, write your own little executor or something, creating a
`Waker` to pass into polling a future was really, really annoying. You had to
deal with, like, manually constructing, like, a vtable from raw pointers. It was
really hairy, and for good reason, because it should be low overhead. But if you
just wanted something to, like, get up and running and you didn't really— the
overhead wasn't that important to you, like you were mocking an executor
something. It was a huge pain. And now what's landed is the `Wake` trait, and
the `Wake` trait is sort of a helper trait. And this might be the first of these
I've seen in the standard library, where what trait does is it— you implement
the `Wake` trait for `Arc` of your type. So implemented for your trait, sorry,
for your type, your `Waker` type. But all of the methods receive an `Arc<Self>`.
And then you implement these sort of methods that are required for wakers that
way. And then the `Wake` trait takes care of implementing `Waker` so that you
can now pass that into the context that's needed for a future. It's a little bit
convoluted, but basically the `Wake` trait makes it so that normal human beings
can implement wakers themselves. And that way can implement executors
themselves, without too much, like, of this additional raw, unsafe business with
vtables that you had to do in the past.

__Ben__: One extremely minor API, wanted to kind of call it here, the
`Peekable::next_if` functions that were now stabilized, and not for the
functions themselves necessarily, but because just for the `Peekable` combinator
on iterators, which allows you to take an iterator and then make it so that you
can see the next element of the iterator without advancing the iterator. So it's
a very kind of like, nice, convenient thing that I think needs more press.

__Jon__: Oh, yeah, `Peekable` is fantastic. I use that a lot. And in fact, I
think the easiest way to get a `Peekable` is if you have any iterator, you can
just call `peekable()` on it and that gives you a `Peekable` iterator.

__Ben__: Yeah, it's great.

__Jon__: And then I did my deep dive into the other changes. Here too, I think
there are two that I want to call out. The first one is a really nice quality of
life improvement for `rustdoc`, where now it will show you the documentation for
methods that you get through deref, even if you go multiple levels deep. So the
example from the PR is, imagine you have some type `foo` that implements `Deref`
to `PathBuf`, or let's use `String` instead. `String` might be a better example.
So `foo` implements `Deref` to `String>` and `String`, of course, implements
`Deref` to `str`, and previously if you render the documentation for `foo`, you
would only get the methods from `Deref` `String`, not the ones from `String`'s
`Deref` to `str`. But now you will get the the methods sort of inherited through
`Deref` all the way down. So it would include both `String` and `str`. Or if you
had something that `Deref`s to `PathBuf` it would include both the methods from
`PathBuf` and the methods from `Path`, which `PathBuf` implements `Deref` to
`Path`. So that's nice. It just means that our documentation is going to be more
complete, like it'll actually show off all the things that you can call without
you having to, like, click your way through a large hierarchy of types.

The other one is much lower level. And that is, there's this configuration
option you can set for `rustc` called `target-cpu`, which is basically, which
CPU should you compile this code for, and that dictates things like which
optimizations are enabled, but also which instructions are enabled. So different
processors often have different sort of instructions that do particular things
in a more optimized fashion. And there's a value you can pass for `target-cpu`,
which is `target-cpu = native`, which is basically, figure out what CPU I have,
and then compile the fastest code you can for my CPU. And this is something that
can often lead to pretty significant improvements in runtime. But it had this
unfortunate, I guess bug, or it was just very— it was very naive, in that if you
gave `target-cpu = native`, it used to be that it just sort of figured out the
name of your processor, and then enabled the features that a processor by that
name should have. And this has two failure modes. One is if your processor
happens to not implement a feature that's implied by its name, then now you're
going to get a binary that you can't run because it's using instructions your
CPU doesn't support. There's also the other way around, where if your CPU
reports to be a processor of a given name or a given family, and that family of
processors don't usually support a given instruction, but your processor does,
then you would lose out on that optimization on the use of that instruction. And
so now what's landed is, if you specify `target-cpu = native`, it will actually
detect all of the different features, rather than going by processor family. And
so now you should only get the features that your processor supports, And that
might mean that you now get more features, like faster code, more widely used or
wider use of instructions. And it also means fewer mis-compilations. So this is
just like a nice thing for those who want to squeeze every last little droplet
of performance out of their programs.

__Ben__: Reminds me kind of, of websites that used to test the `User-Agent`.
That's kind of like the old behavior—

__Jon__: Yeah, it's exactly like that.

__Ben__: And now it's about testing which APIs you support, which is the nice
way of doing things.

__Jon__: Yeah, it's really the right way to do things is I think, the way to
think about it. I think at the tail end here, I didn't have anything more about
1.51, but there's been another— we sort of like on this podcast, I think, to
call out larger ecosystem efforts that you might want to get involved with. And
one of these that that you mentioned, Ben, was the async Rust shared vision,
document, or working group. You want to talk a little bit about this?

__Ben__: Sure. So, async Rust, obviously, just like how const generics became an
MVP this release, async support in Rust is still kind of an MVP. There are a lot
of future improvements that are kind of needed to make it more ergonomic, more
useful, more capable. And a lot of the planning for this has been kind of
stalled on, like getting user feedback. And so the people working on async right
now are requesting feedback from people saying, Hey, like, how do you use async?
How do you, like, how is it currently and what would you expect it to be like?
And they kind of want to create this vision document to figure out, okay, where
should we go? What we pursue next? What are our goals? Where should Rust async
be in, like, five years? So we will [link to this][episode], there's a great
blog post by Niko Matsakis. And you can participate. You can— I think he's been
doing weekly meetings with folks kind of trying to, like— in the community, just
to, like, be like, what is your need? What do you envision? So if you use async
Rust, feel free to chip in, give your experience and what you think Rust should
go towards.

__Jon__: Yeah, and I've been watching— they've set up, like, a repository for
this where you can sort of submit issues and PRs with your story, if you will.
And one thing that I think is worth calling out is that it can be really simple.
It's not— you're not expected to propose, like a solution. You're not expected
to know everything about the problem or anything like that. It's really just if
there— if you've ever tried something with async and it didn't work or something
was a pain, then tell us about it so that we know about this use case and know
to sort of optimize for it. Know that it's a real one. And it can really just be
about writing a short story about some experience you had with async and Rust. I
think that the phrase from the blog post is, "our goal is to engage the entire
community in a collective act of the imagination," which I think is a very nice
way to phrase it.

I think that's everything. I think we got through two more releases, Ben.

__Ben__: Yeah, we're getting older. Yeah, As Rust gets older, so do we.

__Jon__: Yeah, I hope we don't age with the Rust version numbers. That would be
unfortunate. I think as a last call to action, remember that Rustacean Station
is a community podcast. So if you have anything you want to see an episode on,
if there's a technical contribution, or a project, or a feature, or a feature
request, or just a person you want to talk to, you like someone you want to
interview, anything like that. Then please reach out to us. We have a Discord
where you can reach both Ben and me and a bunch of people in the community. And
we'll help you get started, get set up and record an episode and get it out
there. It gets better, the more people sort of put things that they are
interested in out there. And we're happy to help.

__Ben__: Yeah.

__Jon__: And with that, I guess we will now shut down, Ben, and restart our cron
jobs. And then we will turn back on again in 12 weeks.

__Ben__: Three months.

__Jon__: Nice.

__Ben__: Alright.

__Jon__: See you then, Ben.

__Ben__: See you around, folks.

__Jon__: Bye.

__Ben__: Bye.
