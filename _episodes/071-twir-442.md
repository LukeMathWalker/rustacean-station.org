[Tim McNamara][tim], [Sean Chen][sean] and [Allen Wyma][allen] discuss their
highlights from [This Week in Rust
442](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2022/05/04/this-week-in-rust-442/).
Themes include security, testing, embedded development and async Rust. And the
Ada programming language makes a cameo towards the end!

<!--
The episode introduction goes here.
The first paragraph should ideally be short, and is used in various
places as a "short description" for the episode. Any subsequent
paragraphs show up as "expanded description".

The episode starts by discussing the official updates from the newsletter, which
include a [security announcement][] and the [cross-team collaboration fun times (CTCFT) meeting
agenda][ctcft]. (CTCFT had three great talks: [A whirlwind tour of Embedded
  Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfG7OvfVYQY&t=105s) by James
  Munns/jamesmunns, [Async Rust for Embedded
  Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfG7OvfVYQY&t=1260s) by Dario
  Nieuwenhuis/Dirbaio, and [Rust in
  Automotive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfG7OvfVYQY&t=2760s) by Christof
  Petig/cpetig and Florian Gilcher/skade.)

Allen focused predominantly on the web and developer productivity.

- [Rocket web framework's v0.5 2nd release candidate being
announced](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/news/2022-05-09-version-0.5-rc.2/)
- [RepliByte's release
announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ukmnow/an_opensource_tool_to_seed_your_dev_database_with/)
- [Rust Safety with Quentin Ochem and Florian Gilcher](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/067-quentin-ochem-florian-gilcher/)

Sean decided to pick some fun geek topics.

- [Kani Rust Verifier
  Project](https://model-checking.github.io/kani-verifier-blog/2022/05/04/announcing-the-kani-rust-verifier-project.html)
- [Over-Engineering A Fairly Simple
Coding Challenge](https://ada-x64.github.io/over-engineering/)
- [Parsing/Recursive Descent Parser](https://www.huy.rocks/everyday/05-08-2022-parsing-recursive-descent-parser)

Tim's picks for the week were mostly related to security and enhancing the
robustness of the crate ecosystem.

- [Xilem](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/05/07/ui-architecture.html), a
UI architecture for Rust
- [Securing
Crates](https://tl8.co/entry/securing-crates) discussing side channel attacks
- [Modeling Interconnected Social and Technical Risks in Open Source Software
  Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04268), a related paper

We hope that you enjoy the episode!
