In the first of our mini-interviews from RustFest 2019, we talk to [Oliver Scherer](https://twitter.com/oli_obk) about [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri), an interpreter for rustc's internal bytecode, its use in `const`-evaluation, and its potential as an external tool for sanitizing `unsafe` code.
