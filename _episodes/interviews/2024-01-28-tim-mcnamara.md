[Tim McNamara](https://tim.mcnamara.nz/), author of [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action) 
and founder at [Accelerant](https://accelerant.dev), sits down with Marco Otte-Witte.

Tim discusses how Rust, despite common perceptions, is relatively easy to learn and how the compiler empowers engineers 
to avoid common mistakes. The conversation also emphasizes Rust's growing adoption in companies, 
its role in addressing long-term maintainability challenges, and its potential to significantly reduce software 
energy consumption, while highlighting the importance of mentorship to ensure successful integration across organizations.
